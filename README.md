Due to using the same name as some other US town name NewGRFs, this NewGRF might not be compatible with them. Disable other US town name NewGRFs before usage.


------------------------
4 Background information
------------------------

Town name likelihoods are weighted by population logarithmically with base 1.2, so cities with higher populations have slightly higher chances of appearing.
Due to limitations regarding the amount of town names possible, this pack only uses places with population >= 500.
Cleaned data comes from cityquiz.io.
NewGRF creation uses some code from Better World Cities.
